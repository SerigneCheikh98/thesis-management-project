TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team ##)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done - 3 vs 3
- Total points committed vs. done - 10 vs 10
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team) - 90h30m vs 96h15m

**Remember**a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!) 

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |    15   |      |      48h30m      |      60h        |
| _#1_   |    5    |    3   |      8h      |    14h25m          |
| _#2_   |    5   |     5   |       9h    |        16h55m      |
| _#3_   |    4     |   2     |      7h      |      4h55m        |
   

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 5h
  - Total hours spent: 5h
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 9
  - Coverage (if available): not available
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 2h30m
  - Total hours spent: 1h
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated: 3h30m
  - Total hours spent: 3h30m
  

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
  - Lack of knowledge of best practices, low familiarity with testing environment and procedures

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?


- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
  - Better management of the project by using Github tools (branches and PRs)
  - Better presentation
  - Improved communication between teammates
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

  > Propose one or two
  - Focus more on integration and e2e tests project and studying the technologies required
  - Prepare a template with real data to use while showing features to the stakeholders (like meaningful thesis proposals, to use for inserting in a form)

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  - We received compliments by the stakeholders about how easy-to-use and understandable our application was.
