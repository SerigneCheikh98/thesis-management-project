TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team 16)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs done - `4` vs `4`
- Total points committed vs done - `14` vs `14`
- Nr of hours planned vs spent (as a team) - `96h15m` vs `95h 50m`

**Remember**  a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed: 

> Please refine your DoD 

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |   16      |    -   |     52h45m       |        48h20m      |
| _#13_   |    8     |    5   |      18h30m      |       21h15m       |
| _#14_   |      4   |    2   |       6h30m     |        6h      |
| _#15_   |    4     |     2  |       5h30m     |    5h40m          |
| _#26_   |     5    |    5   |       13h     |       14h35m       |


> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task (average, standard deviation): average est. `` 2h 36m``; standard deviation est. `` 2h `` ; average spent `` 2h 35m`` ; standard deviation spent `` 1h 54m``
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent -1: `0,004347826`

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated - `` 
  - Total hours spent - `8h20m`
  - Nr of automated unit test cases - ``
  - Coverage (if available) - `%`
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated - ``
  - Total hours spent - `12h30m`
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated - ``
  - Total hours spent - ``
- Technical Debt management:
  - Total hours estimated- `45m`
  - Total hours spent- `45m`
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube: `43m`
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube only for the selected and planned issues: `43m` 
  - Hours spent on remediation: `45m` 
  - debt ratio (as reported by SonarQube under "Measures-Maintainability"): `0,2%`
  - rating for each quality characteristic reported in SonarQube under "Measures" (namely reliability, security, maintainability ): `Reliability`: `A`, `Security`: `A`, `Mantainability`: `A`
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
  - We needed less time than expected to complete all the e2e testing but we spendend more time time planned dealing with the general front end appearence
- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  - **Positive**: we learned how to stick to the scrum process while being all dislocated during the holdays
  - **Negative**: 

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  - We checked more carefully all the requirements of the PO and the FAQ document
  - We finished the development phase earlier to be able to concentrate only on tests and bug fixing the last dates
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  - None

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  > Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  - Our presentations were always well prepared and the work organization always on point
